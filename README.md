# PokeClickerAPI
Api for modding PokeClicker (a good ass game)

# use cases
Mod creations like a boss fight I made a long time ago and some randomizers
adding the game a bit of... ✨Spark!✨

# BE AWARE
people may use the api for making some "troll scripts" that can corrupt your save file
scripts and examples from this repo will NOT include any "troll scripts" and these script is the reason of the
alert when you go to the console that goes like:
" This is a browser feature intended for developers. If you were told to copy-paste or enter something here to obtain an easter egg or unlock a secret, it can corrupt your save file, cause bugs, or otherwise break your game."
before executing ANY SCRIPT take your time and read it, or just run it in an incognito tab and not running it on a vanilla save file. 
personally I think "hack scripts" that ment to be ran in your "personal save file"  ruins the fun of actually playing the game
but what I think isn't bad is playing a mod someone made (:

# CREDIT
u can credit me for working ALOT of time to make the game "better"( and being the greatest man alive) but you don't have to :D
